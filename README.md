# Project-Management-and-System-Development
The speaker presented a clear, structured, and accessible explanation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) within the context of project development. This presentation helped me better understand the importance of managing projects and responsibilities in an organized, systematic, and methodical manner. It also highlighted how effective task organization and proper planning are essential to ensuring the successful execution of a project.

In addition, the speaker emphasized the limitations of relying solely on artificial intelligence, noting that while AI can be a valuable tool for assisting with coding tasks and syntax, it is not always reliable and lacks human reasoning and judgment. As such, greater emphasis should be placed on critical aspects of development such as system design, analysis, and decision-making. In conclusion, the discussion reinforced my understanding of the critical role of the SDLC in modern software development and underscored the need for the careful and responsible application of artificial intelligence in today’s competitive and evolving technological landscape.
